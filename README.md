## Computer GUI automation using Python


Python's PyAutoGUI library allows you to automate mouse and keyboard interaction.     
This is done by sending commands to the operating system to move the mouse, click, and type text.   
PyAutoGUI is useful for automating tasks that cannot be done with Selenium, such as interacting with desktop applications.   

**PyAutoGUI Features:**
- Simulating mouse movements.   
- Clicking on objects.   
- Sending text.   
- Using hotkeys.
- Taking screenshots.   
- Locating an application window.
- Showing alert and message boxes.
